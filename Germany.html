      <p>Adolf Hitler was a soldier during WWI, and was a very patriotic man. It pained him to see how Germany had been ruined by the Treaty of Versailles. Since the army had been reduced in the treaty, Hitler could no longer be a fighter. However, he was given the job of neutralizing a rebellious group known as the German Worker's Party. However, when he visited the meet-up spot, he realized how he could bring back the greatness of Germany. He used his incredible speaking power to convince the people there that Germany could become better if he ruled it, and became head of the party. He decided to rename his party to the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP), or the Nazi party. He admired Benito Mussolini's work in Italy, and incorporated fascist values into his party. On November 8, 1923, Hitler led a march into Berlin, and was arrested. When he became free, President Hindenburg appointed him as German chancellor. Hitler then established a dictatorship in Germany.</p>

    <h2 class = "txt">Invasion of Poland</h2>
    
    
    <div class = "txt">
      <p>Hitler began undoing the Treaty of Versailles, establishing a huge army, and taking over several countries in Europe. He then set his gaze on Poland. Germany had been split in two by the Polish Corridor, an area of Poland that separated Germany from its territory known as East Prussia. Hitler allied with the Soviet Union in order to invade Poland, and Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, agreed. However, the UK and France stated that invading Poland would lead to another war. Hitler did not heed the warnings, and went through with his plan, taking Poland. The UK and France then formally declared war on Nazi Germany.</p>

    <h2 class = "txt">Invasion of France</h2>
    
    
    <div class = "txt">
      <p>Germany began preparing for the invasion of France by militarizing the Rhineland, violating the Treaty of Versailles. Then, Hitler invaded Belgium, and the troops of the UK and France met them. But then, Hitler unleashed a new tactic - blitzkrieg. He sent thousands of refugees toward the troops, slowing them down. Then France had left the Ardennes, a mountainous region that they thought was naturally impenetrable. Hitler sent hundreds of thousands of troops through the Ardennes, encircling the main French army and the British soldiers. They completely wiped out the French, but the British were able to escape from Dunkirk back to the British mainland. The Germans easily swept through France, taking Paris, and succeeding in their invasion.</p>

    <h2 class = "txt">Invasion of the Soviet Union</h2>
    
    <div class = "txt">
      <p>After taking France, Hitler began preparing troops for an invasion of the Soviet Union. He amassed millions of troops, and began training them for the war. Codenamed Operation Barbarossa, it would hopefully remove a huge threat to Hitler's reign. On June 22, 1941, Hitler began the invasion of the Soviet Union. It was the largest land invasion in history, with over 3 million Axis troops. The Germans began encircling armies and wiping out huge numbers of troops. His invasion was succeeding, until winter set in. The troops stopped the fighting through the winter. When spring arrived, Hitler continued the invasion, but with a plan in mind. He wanted to cut off the Caucasus region of Russia, and take all the oil-rich land there. He split his troops for the invasion,  and started to get cocky. He left only one division to attack the key Russian city of Stalingrad. The problem was the Russians weren't going to give up Stalingrad, and the war was now in Stalin's favour. He was able to push the Nazis further back, and Hitler was now losing the battle on the Eastern Front.</p>

      <p>The allies had pushed Germany and Italy out of Africa, and were planning an invasion through Italy. Since Hitler knew how incapable the Italian troops were, he sent German troops to Italy to help fortify it. When the invasion begun, German soldiers fought hard, but the Italians were not interested in the war at that point. The German soldiers disarmed Italian forces in an operation known as Operation Axis in order to continue the war. Eventually, the fighting was halted when it reached close to Germany.</p>
