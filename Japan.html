      <p>For over 200 years, the Japanese had isolated themselves from the world, until the Western powers wanted to trade with them. However, since Japan had little resources, their economy started to fail. Japan decided to get some resources from its neighbour, China. So, Japan launched a invasion of Korea. The West told them to stop, so they did, but then they saw the West taking advantage of China. Japan decided that, to get more of China, they had to the area occupied by Russia. They declared war on Russia, and surprisingly, they won. They continued taking Chinese territory. The Japanese hated the Chinese, and were very harsh to the people they captured. Particularly, at the city of Nanking, they committed one of the worst atrocities ever.</p>

    <h2 class = "txt">Pearl Harbour</h2>
    
    <div class = "txt">
      <p>Japan wanted to take more territory in the Pacific, but there was one main problem: the United States. The US owned many islands in the Pacific, so the Japanese had to stop the Pacific fleet from attacking them while they expanded their sphere of influence. On December 7, 1941, Japanese bombers attacked Pearl Harbour on the Oahu island in Hawaii, causing the deaths of 2,403 Americans. The attack did destroy many ships, but it did not destroy the fuselage tanks or repair facilities. This would allow the US to quickly get ready for a war.</p>

      <p>The United States had taken back its territories that had been captured by Japan. Now they had to stop Japan from fighting. First, bombing of major cities occurred. The Japanese did not surrender. After that, the U.S. decided to use a new bomb they had created - the atomic bomb. On August 6, 1945, pilot Paul Tibbets flew a plane that dropped the atomic bomb, named "Little Boy," on Hiroshima. On August 9, the bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. Japan declared a formal surrender from the war on September 2, 1945.</p>
