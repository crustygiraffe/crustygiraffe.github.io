    <h2>Causes of WII</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li>The Treaty of Versailles</li>
      <li>The rise of fascism in Europe</li>
      <li>Japan's quest for a bigger empire</li>
      <li>Germany's quest to increase the living space of Germans</li>
      <li>The belief of racial superiority</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Outcome of WWII</h2>
<p>The outcome of WWII was Germany being split in half, Italy losing its fascist government, and Japanese islands being taken back by the US. The atomic bomb led to a new kind of warfare, which would be showcased in the next important war - the Cold War. Rising tensions between the US and Russia, two superpowers with opposing ideologies, would also cause the Cold War to occur. The war left more than 80 million people dead, millions killed in battle, and millions killed by experiments and mass genocides based on the idea of racial and physical superiority. In particular, the Holocaust left over 11 million people dead, with over 6 million of those being Jews.</p>
